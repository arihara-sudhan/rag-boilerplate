Ari was walking back home one late evening through his village fields. The sky had turned violet, and the first stars began to shimmer. As he crossed the old banyan tree, he noticed something glowing near its roots. It looked like a small shard of light pulsing faintly.

Curious, he picked it up. The moment his fingers touched it, a strange warmth ran through his body. His eyes flickered golden for an instant, and he felt every sound, every breath of wind, every heartbeat around him. It was as if the world had slowed down.

The shard had chosen him.

From that day, Ari discovered he could pause time for everything around him while he moved freely. Birds froze mid-air, rain halted mid-fall, conversations locked mid-word, yet Ari could walk among them, think, and act.

At first, he used it playfully. He finished homework instantly, sneaked extra snacks from the kitchen, and watched sunsets frame by frame. But soon, he realized he could do more. He could stop accidents before they happened, save lives, and give second chances.

The power came with a whispering warning: “Time bends, but never breaks. Use it wisely.”

Ari had gained more than just a superpower. He had gained a responsibility to decide when to let time flow and when to hold it still.
